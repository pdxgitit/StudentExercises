# Given a string, find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'bad'. If the 'bad' follows
# the 'not', replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring with 'good'.
# Return the resulting string. So 'This dinner is not that bad!' yields: This dinner is good!

# 'This movie is not so bad' -> 'This movie is good'
# 'This dinner is not that bad!' -> 'This dinner is good!'
# 'This tea is not hot' -> 'This tea is not hot'
# "It's bad yet not" -> "It's bad yet not"
