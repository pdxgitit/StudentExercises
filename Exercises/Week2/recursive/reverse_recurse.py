# write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the reversal
# of that string—that is, the string in reverse order. So, if we give this
# function “spam”, it should return the string “maps.” If we give it “alien”,
# it should return “neila”

# Write this function using recursion!

# Hint:  The reverse of an empty string is just the string itself
    # -> BASE CASE
